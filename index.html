                Regardless of their level, a football player's kit is about confidence as much as it's about
                performance. From junior to professional, it's your amour from self-doubt. A reminder that no matter
                where you are in the journey "from grassroots to greatness," you belong there. And yet, this critical
                step in preparing the team's next season has been surprisingly traditional.

            <h4>
                Turning Athletes into Designers
            </h4>
            <p>
                The process began with one representative from the team meeting with a retailer armed with notes from
                players and management. This customer then explains what they are looking for, pointing to samples that
                are not quite right while flipping through a pile of catalogs the retailer offers. Hopefully, one of
                them is Nike.

            <h4>Moving away from the hassle of paper catalogues</h4>
            <p>These clients had a clear idea of what they wanted but had no accurate way to capture and communicate it.
                To make matters worse, there were numerous ways their design could be misinterpreted. Teams would
                verbally describe how they wanted their kits to look and hoped that every person in the assembly chain
                would understand. Catalogue photography struggled to capture how material genuinely looked, leading to
                misaligned expectations for the final product. In the end, XX% of orders that did make it to Nike was
                returned for not matching the desired result.</p>

            <h4>Developing a powerful 3D tool</h4>
            <p>A software solution powerful enough to enable players and coaches to become designers, yet light enough
                to run from niketeamfootball.com, would be the single solution to a list of problems. With a simplified
                customer-facing kit experience, we skipped photography and its limitations to embrace 3D models. We
                required 3D models so precise that you could almost touch the material to avoid new wave returns.</p>
            <p>In our search for the right partner, we met Smoke & Mirrors, specialists in scanning 3D fabrics. With a
                rig of 180 cameras capturing hi-res data where each final article of clothing, from shirts to socks,
                contained more than 2Gb. This method allowed for creating digital twins of Nike's materials, delivered
                in layers that enabled exceptionally flexible customization.</p>

            <h4>A solution build to scale that creates digital twins</h4>
            <p>With 40 individual colours, 20 unique jersey designs, we have given clients the power to control every
                variable. Adding up model choice, colour combination, and material selection provides thousands of
                options before you even get to team and sponsor logos with player names. Client accounts allow the
                designated designer to share the results with every team member before approaching a retailer.
                Consequently, the true-to-life renders dramatically reduced returns by a projected XX%. Likewise, it
                significantly reduced the workflow, removing the need to photograph every colour.</p>
            <p>For retailers, players and teams, it provides them with the latest Nike sport innovations and
                information. The simplified experience secures trust that players will receive precisely the kits they
                design. The signature Nike style for visuals means the kit configurator generates striking design assets
                that are applied throughout the customer journey—in social, shop experience, order confirmation and even
                aftercare.</p>
